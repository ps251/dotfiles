 ;; Currently, we support either "Markdown" or "Org".
 ;; This can overwrite your global preference so that
 ;; maybe your personal preferred format is Org but you'd
 ;; need to use Markdown for some projects.
 :preferred-format :org

 ;; Preferred workflow style.
 ;; Value is either ":now" for NOW/LATER style,
 ;; or ":todo" for TODO/DOING style.
 :preferred-workflow :now

 ;; The app will ignore those directories or files.
 ;; E.g. "/archived" "/test.md"
 :hidden []

 ;; When creating the new journal page, the app will use your template if there is one.
 ;; You only need to input your template name here.

:journal/page-title-format "yyyy-MM-dd"

 ;; Whether to enable hover on tooltip preview feature
 ;; Default is true, you can also toggle this via setting page
 :ui/enable-tooltip? true

 ;; Enable Block timestamp
 :feature/enable-block-timestamps? false

 ;; Disable Built-in Scheduled and deadline Query
 ;; :feature/disable-scheduled-and-deadline-query? true

 ;; Specify the date on which the week starts.
 ;; Goes from 0 to 6 (Monday to Sunday), default to 6
 :start-of-week 6

 ;; Specify a custom CSS import
 ;; This option take precedence over your local `logseq/custom.css` file
 ;; You may find a list of awesome logseq themes here:
 ;; https://github.com/logseq/awesome-logseq#css-themes
 ;; Example:
 ;; :custom-css-url "@import url('https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/dracula/logseq@master/custom.css');"

 ;; Set Bullet indentation when exporting
 ;; default option: tab
 ;; Possible options are for `:sidebar` are
 ;; 1. `:eight-spaces` as eight spaces
 ;; 2. `:four-spaces` as four spaces
 ;; 3. `:two-spaces` as two spaces
 ;; :export/bullet-indentation :tab


 ;; When :all-pages-public? true, export repo would export all pages within that repo.
 ;; Regardless of whether you've set any page to public or not.
 ;; Example:
 ;; :publishing/all-pages-public? true

 ;; Specify default home page and sidebar status for Logseq
 ;; If not specified, Logseq default opens journals page on startup
 ;; value for `:page` is name of page
 ;; Possible options for `:sidebar` are
 ;; 1. `"Contents"` to open up `Contents` in sidebar by default
 ;; 2. `page name` to open up some page in sidebar
 ;; 3. Or multiple pages in an array ["Contents" "Page A" "Page B"]
 ;; If `:sidebar` is not set, sidebar will be hidden
 ;; Example:
 ;; 1. Setup page "Changelog" as home page and "Contents" in sidebar
 ;; :default-home {:page "Changelog", :sidebar "Contents"}
 ;; 2. Setup page "Jun 3rd, 2021" as home page without sidebar
 ;; :default-home {:page "Jun 3rd, 2021"}
 ;; 3. Setup page "home" as home page with multiple pages in sidebar
 ;; :default-home {:page "home" :sidebar ["page a" "page b"]}

 ;; if not specified, notes are stored in `pages` directory
 ;; :pages-directory "your-directory"

 ;; Tell logseq to use a specific folder in the repo as a default location for journals
 ;; if not specified, journals are stored in `journals` directory
 ;; :journals-directory "your-directory"

 ;; Set this to true will convert
 ;; `[[Grant Ideas]]` to `[[file:./grant_ideas.org][Grant Ideas]]` for org-mode
 ;; For more, see https://github.com/logseq/logseq/issues/672

* Keybindings
#+begin_src elisp
 ;; Setup custom shortcuts under `:shortcuts` key
 ;; Syntax:
 ;; 1. `+` means keys pressing simultaneously. eg: `ctrl+shift+a`
 ;; 2. ` ` empty space between keys represents key chords. eg: `t s` means press `s` follow by `t`
 ;; 3. `mod` means `Ctrl` for Windows/Linux  and `Command` for Mac
 ;; 4. use `false` to disable particular shortcut
 ;; 4. you can define multiple bindings for one action, eg `["ctrl+j" "down"]`
 ;; full list of configurable shortcuts are available below:
 ;; https://github.com/logseq/logseq/blob/master/src/main/frontend/modules/shortcut/config.cljs
 ;; Example:
 ;; :shortcuts
 ;; {:editor/new-block       "enter"
 ;;  :editor/new-line        "shift+enter"
 ;;  :editor/insert-link     "mod+shift+k"

 ;;  :ui/toggle-settings     "t s"
 ;;  :editor/up              ["ctrl+k" "up"]
 ;;  :editor/down            ["ctrl+j" "down"]
 ;;  :editor/left            ["ctrl+h" "left"]
